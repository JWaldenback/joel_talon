I have a command which is accessible in text.talon  but I want to make more specific versions of this command for different websites and programs. I thought I could pattern match it with browser.host for certain websites and this would then override the more general command but it doesn't seem to work for me. Any ideas why?

you shouldn't override commands at the text level, you should bind them to actions and override the actions. if you have roughly the same command available multiple times, it's unclear which one will take priority. but actions have a well defined priority

#In Google docs an additional edit.extend_left() seems to be needed but not in other applications/websites
select around: 
    edit.word_left()
    edit.extend_word_right()
    edit.extend_word_right()
    #edit.extend_left()

#go word left: edit.word_left()
#go word right: edit.word_right()

contract (word | it):
    edit.word_left()
    edit.extend_word_right()
    edit.extend_word_right()
    #edit.extend_left()
    user.formatters_reformat_selection("smash")
    sleep(300ms)
    key(space)
 
sink (word | it):
    edit.select_word()
    user.formatters_reformat_selection("all down")
    #edit.left()
    sleep(300ms)
    key(space)

ship (word | it):
    edit.select_word()
    user.formatters_reformat_selection("title")
    #edit.left()
    sleep(300ms)
    key(space)
